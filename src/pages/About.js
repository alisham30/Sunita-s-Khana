            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>
              Sunita's Khana began with a simple passion for authentic Indian cooking. Founded by Sunita Mathias in 2020, 
              our journey started in a small kitchen with family recipes passed down through generations.
            </p>
            <p>
              What began as cooking for friends and family quickly grew into a beloved culinary destination 
              for those seeking genuine Indian flavors. Today, we're proud to bring these time-honored recipes 
              directly to your home, prepared with the same care and attention to detail as they would be in our own kitchen.
